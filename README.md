## 🌷 About Me

I’m a UX Design student passionate about creating intuitive, user-friendly digital experiences.  
Currently learning UX research, wireframing, prototyping, and front-end development to better understand how design and code work together.

I believe good design is not just about how it looks — but how it works.
